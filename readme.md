# Performant Web API with uWebSockets.js

## Overview

This project is a Node.js web API that leverages the high-performance capabilities of uWebSockets.js to create a fast and efficient server. It is designed to provide an API that feels more like working with Express, making it easier to use while also utilizing the performance benefits of uWebSockets.js.

## Key Features

- **Express-like API:** The project wraps uWebSockets.js in a way that mimics the API style of Express
- **Middleware Support:** Similar to Express, this project supports the use of middleware functions to process requests and responses.
- **Performant data Parsing:** Optimized request body parsing to handle data efficiently
- **Route grouping:** Routes can be grouped together and have middleware run only for that group
